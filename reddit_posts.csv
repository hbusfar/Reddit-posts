0,b1kvoh,Update,"r/economy is for news and discussion of the economy and economics - worldwide, national, and local. Markets, stock news, currency news, trade talks, industry news, and pretty much anything else related to the economy including economic theories and models. There are different types - if you want to discuss how laissez-faire economics compares to market socialism, or neoliberal economics vs. mercantilism, you can do that here. Neoclassical economics, Chicago School, Austrian School, Keynesian, Periphery/Core Analysis, Marxist, and everything in between, are all legitimate topics. Everyone is welcome no matter where you live or where you're from.

This is not a partisan or political sub. However, economics and politics are highly interrelated. There is an academic discipline called Political Economy. Political factors tend to determine economic outcomes. So attempts to split the two subjects are usually unsuccessful. Politics is generally going to leak into any discussion about money and economics. That's unavoidable and is perfectly ok.

That being said, there are rules in the sidebar. Everyone has had plenty of time to read them. From now on, they will be more strictly enforced. Anyone attempting to discredit sources and/or derail discussions by crying ""propaganda"", ""state-owned media"", ""You're a bot"", etc, is risking a ban. 

In addition, anyone expressing support for the terrorist in Christchurch yesterday, or previous such terrorist attacks, or any copycat attacks in the future, will be banned. There's no place for that here.",0

20,djnh3f,China government has legally stolen 375.23 billions job from USA in a single year of 2017 by anti-freedom trade (China government said 275.8 billions),"China government has legally stolen 375.23 billions job from USA in a single year of 2017 by anti-freedom trade (China government said 275.8 billions)

For decades, China government has stolen a lot of high techs from the United States, and for decades, American goods are generally heavily taxed by China government（visible and invisible to rocket the prices), while most Chinese goods are even not taxed in the United States (or taxed very little), which not only hurts American producers and American workers, but also hurts Chinese consumers because they cannot enjoy a lot of safe and cheap American goods, for decades!

(Of course not Boeing 737, because it probably kills thousands of customers over the world. For those death customers, it is sure that Boeing 737 is the unsafest product they had ever met, proved by their death.)

According to USA Census Bureau, China has stolen 375.23 billions from the United States in a single year of 2017. According to China Census Bureau, China has stolen 275.8 billions from the United States in a single year of 2017. President Trump only taxes China 60 billions in the early 2018? That is obviously not enough to get true free trade without tariffs.

""American goods are generally heavily taxed by China government（visible and invisible to rocket the prices), while most Chinese goods are even not taxed in the United States (or taxed very little), "" For example you buy an ordinary cheap USA good in Amazon or Walmart at $40, but in China you have to pay 600 Yuan (that is $95) in China's biggest B2C for the same USA good, and you can hardly get it in China's supermarkets. Cars are also an example, you buy an safe USA car in USA at $50000, but in China you may have to pay $100000 for the same USA car. Obviously, if all USA goods can be sold in China at the same price in USA, sales of USA goods would rocket definitely, and 375.23 (or 275.8) billions deficit would disappear definitely, and millions more Americans could have jobs definitely. Also Chinese consumers could enjoy a lot more safe and cheap American goods without deficit, and with spending much less money. And that is the true free trade.

Believing communists? Are you kidding me? In 1989,they killed more than ten thousand unarmed people in one day, by using machine guns and tanks! They said maybe a little hundreds of people are dead by accident, and they robbed all cameras even from Western diplomats without any explanation. In 1998，they said they bought the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov just for gambling business. Now it is well known as China's first aircraft carrier, starting to threaten America army. In 2001,they said they would open China's market to USA, and Chinese consumers have expected American goods for more than ten years, but still hard to buy or much more expensive than in USA, some of who fly to USA shopping. Ok, China consumers lost. USA lost (losing 375.23 billions to China government just in one year). Only China government won. Ok, some American companies also won,but only freedom lost (for example,USA company sold anti-freedom system to China, bingo, China sold anti-freedom system to Korea and Iran\[size=1em\])

What is freedom? Is freedom America first or Nazi first?

Basically, what is free trade? No tariffs.  

Yeah, the trade war should be done last year, and Nazi America still does not care about Hong Kong because Hong Kong has been decided as a dog of communists China not freedom China in 1997, just as 1949 and 1971, and of course the earliest is 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act . And of course America is first, although freedom China sacrificed more than millions of soldiers to defeat the only enemy who attacked China and America and after that had been sacrificed by America with America doing nothing.

Yeah, such as

""support ZTE"" , and ""delay tariff for communist china's day Oct. 1"",

because

slow coward failure America just wants the trade war as long as possible, as slow slow slow as possible. And even that taxing on 550 billions was also said by America long long ago, just as said ""soon"" and ""very soon"".

America super loves rapists and Islam\*c serial artistic killers who are rich and thus a good ally, as all know, removed and banned many many times.

Rape is nothing and coward USA would let communist rapist free, which is often banned to speak in redd\*t. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9f7gla/rape\_is\_nothing\_and\_coward\_usa\_would\_let/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9f7gla/rape_is_nothing_and_coward_usa_would_let/)

US supplied bomb that killed 40 children on Yemen school bus , with smart missiles which are smart enough to recognize and kill easy-to-kill children to show US has balls when being fucked off by hard-to-kill Russians.

​Slow coward failure America likes to make the war as long as possible, already said far far more earlier and banned. [https://old.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9zxf1r/is\_america\_slow\_coward\_failure\_again\_where\_is/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9zxf1r/is_america_slow_coward_failure_again_where_is/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/8oqhe2/china\_government\_has\_legally\_stolen\_37523/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/8oqhe2/china_government_has_legally_stolen_37523/)

Is slow coward USA doing the same thing that USA just waits a few months until China yuan is down 10% to $, then dares to tax 10% on $505 billions, and thus gets 10%-10%=0% in real trade? After all, USA has loved China communists and their ZTE for decades. My English is so bad?

​1, USA shouts that USA would put tariff on $500 billion goods made in China to change anti-freedom trade with China.

2, China devalues (downs) its currency yuan 10% to USA currency $.

3, then USA dares to really put tariff 10%, and gets nothing in real trade because 10%-10%=0%, which means that prices of goods made in China are decreased 10% by means of China government devaluing yuan 10%, and prices of goods made in China are increased 10% by meanings of USA government putting tariff 10% on all, and thus prices in trade not changed in total.

​4, ZTE is always controlled by China communists, and sells anti-freedom system to Iran and Korea, and banned by USA and then supported by USA later.

Just the first sentence I said, if you cannot read more sentences. ""Coward USA is too slow, which would make the war last long and thus make USA fail eventually.""

Coward USA is too slow, which would make the war last long and make USA fail. China yuan is already down 4% to USA dollar. So the real tariff in trade would be 10%-4%\*500/200=0% for the new 10% tariff on $200 billions of China goods.

Notice: $500 billions is the minimal of goods made in China exported to USA. So China yuan downing (or devaluation of China currency to America currency, now about 4% down) affects more than $500 billions goods exported to USA, but new tariffs expected only affects $200 billions goods exported to USA. So the result of the new tariffs on the whole trade of goods made in China but exported to America here is only 10%-4%\*500/200=0%.

Maybe USA can keep torturing Children (news about immigrants) and infants (news about USA believing cow milk is much better than mother milk or breast milk for infants), and make China communists keep stealing $375 billions and millions of American jobs from USA every year, since all these would make America great again.

Is USA a coward failure only shouting 200 billion and shouting 500 billion with doing nothing real while China communists have been keeping beating USA?

The simplest example in life to see the unfair robbery nature of China communists...(rob money from Chinese,rob work from American)

If you transfer money from banks not in China (for example, D) to China bank,Zero fee. But if you transfer back,that's to say, if you transfer money from China bank to banks not in China (for example,D), very high fee. That's the fairness? So, we got to know why China bank would not like fair competition with other banks, and China communists did unfair competition very well. (By the way, there is a little fact : China top four communist banks are the four biggest and richest banks all over the world. )

China bank says: If you transfer money out of mainland,for example, if you transfer money to USA , the fee is 1‰， 50￥ at least for each.And there is also tele fee,150￥ each time. And there also may be other fees. ​ So, if you are a Chinese and want to buy an American goods, you transfer 500￥ to your account outside China, and China bank just simply takes off more than 200￥ from you just because you want to buy an American goods. Moreover, if you take this American goods back to China, you may face high tax by China communists as well because American goods' prices are much higher in China than in America while many Chinese goods' prices are obviously lower in America than in China . So, we got to know why China goods would not like fair competition with America goods, and China communists did unfair competition very well. (By the way, there is a little fact: China communists legally steal $375 billions and millions of American jobs from USA in 2017 by anti-freedom trade.) ​And all above here lasts for decades!

Seen in ""China government has legally stolen 375.23 billions from USA in a single year by anti-freedom trade"" [http://bbs.aboluowang.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1062885&amp;extra=page%3D2](http://bbs.aboluowang.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1062885&amp;extra=page%3D2)

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to learn about economics a little bit. I'm not new to the topic but not too advanced either. Can you recommend any source I can learn from? I prefer videos/documentaries and articles/books that can keep up my interest while reading.

Subjects I'm interested in among others:

* **Global economy**: how economy works across countries; what does affect it; trading agreements; what is capitalism; globalization; etc.
* **Stocks**: how stock markets work; how they affect world economy and vice versa; how stock market behaves; analyzing; etc.
* **Business**: how corporates work; private and public companies; corporate structures (CEO, board of directos, chairmen, what they do, etc.); how stake works in public companies (buying out, dividends, etc.); owning (parents, subsidiares, one company buying the other, etc.); holding companies; etc.
* **Other securities** like bonds
* **Safe assets** like gold or Bitcoin(?)

So I would accept sources in any topics if it's a useful one. Hope this is a good place to ask this question. I don't break the rules tho :D

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome to the first article form the series of Blockchain and cryptocurrency educational materials - Blockchain explained. Being a part of the Darb Academy project, the series will bring you closer to the key definitions and concepts joined with the subject of blockchain and cryptocurrency trading.

In our first reveal of „Blockchain Explained” we would like to bring you closer to the concept of Cryptocurrency mining.

\*\*WHO ARE MINERS\*\*

Miners are people directly responsible for registering your transactions on the blockchain ledger.

The mining process is supported by a Peer 2 Peer network, that is registering mining activity in real-time. Every one of us can become a miner with the right amount of mining dedicated hardware and an internet connection. At the beginning of cryptocurrency mining, a personal computer was more than enough to acquire a sufficient amount of computing power to dig on the hash. With time, however, the process of finding a magic number is becoming increasingly demanding.  What hardware is now adequate to the mining requirements? The one with the most computing power! Graphic cards and integrated circuits proved to be most efficient, with dedicated units being available on the market for more optimized mining. The mining process involves some risk, let us explain them to you. 

\*\*MINING RISKS\*\*

First of all, mining a bitcoin does not always equal to acquiring the bitcoin. All mining entities are dedicated to mining the same block, but there will be only one winner of this race. The miner that will be first to discover the hash, frequently called a magic number, will be the one to receive the Bitcoins and transaction fees associated with the block. Even after the hash is dug, it is too early to call it a success. The block has still to be followed by at least 5 other blocks to be included in the blockchain with all certainty. There are however possibilities of increasing your chances. In order to step ahead of the race, miners invest in more hardware (more computing power) and join into mining hubs, in which several miners work on the same block and then split the prize adequately to the contribution. Second of all, the process can generate high costs due to the energy consumption of mining units. In China, which is the biggest crypto mining industry maintaining around 60% to 70% of the world's bitcoin mining network, occurred several instances of charging miners and mining hubs with allegations of electricity theft. To avoid any trouble with the law, and what’s more important, to make sure that the process is profitable in the first place, it’s of utmost importance for miners to calculate power usage and costs that go with it. In some instances, mining bitcoin might not even be worth it! Everything depends on the price of power in your location and your mining capability or other words hashing power. If you want to start mining, use mining calculators available online to estimate your income.",0

68,dj3jjw,Is donating money to the homeless bad for the economy?,"I was watching some videos of Japan's economy lately and found out that the nation has a stagnant GDP growth rate chiefly due to the fact of how people are working to support the old people who have already retired and will not work again which is paired with a scarce birth rate. Japan apparently has the world's oldest population and with all that information grouped together, it kind of makes sense.

But wouldn't it be similar with homelessness, and worse? The average homeless person (excluding temporary ones like being divorced and having no proper shelter for a few days to a fortnight) will never escape homelessness. When you give money to them, there's also a chance of them spending it on drugs from things like the black market which is said to be unhealthy for the economy due to various reasons. If the said homeless person doesn't spend that money on drugs though, wouldn't they still be using up more resources than they give back because they're taking free money for their gain but aren't working to pay it back? 

&amp;#x200B;

If we were in a world without any homeless people meaning there wouldn't be any homeless people to donate to, would the economy be the same? Would there be any change in our resources?",0

📷  
 

&amp;#x200B;

Win,  Such as

""support ZTE"" , and ""delay tariff for communist china's day Oct. 1"",

because

slow coward failure America just wants the trade war as long as possible, as slow slow slow as possible. And even that taxing on 550 billions was also said by America long long ago, just as said ""soon"" and ""very soon"".

America super loves rapists and Islam\*c serial artistic killers who are rich and thus a good ally, as all know, removed and banned many many times.

Rape is nothing and coward USA would let communist rapist free, which is often banned to speak in redd\*t. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9f7gla/rape\_is\_nothing\_and\_coward\_usa\_would\_let/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9f7gla/rape_is_nothing_and_coward_usa_would_let/)

US supplied bomb that killed 40 children on Yemen school bus , with smart missiles which are smart enough to recognize and kill easy-to-kill children to show US has balls when being fucked off by hard-to-kill Russians. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/19/us-supplied-bomb-that-killed-40-children-school-bus-yemen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/19/us-supplied-bomb-that-killed-40-children-school-bus-yemen)

​Slow coward failure America likes to make the war as long as possible, already said far far more earlier and banned. [https://old.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9zxf1r/is\_america\_slow\_coward\_failure\_again\_where\_is/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/9zxf1r/is_america_slow_coward_failure_again_where_is/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/8oqhe2/china\_government\_has\_legally\_stolen\_37523/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/8oqhe2/china_government_has_legally_stolen_37523/)

Is slow coward USA doing the same thing that USA just waits a few months until China yuan is down 10% to $, then dares to tax 10% on $505 billions, and thus gets 10%-10%=0% in real trade? After all, USA has loved China communists and their ZTE for decades. My English is so bad?

​1, USA shouts that USA would put tariff on $500 billion goods made in China to change anti-freedom trade with China.

2, China devalues (downs) its currency yuan 10% to USA currency $.

3, then USA dares to really put tariff 10%, and gets nothing in real trade because 10%-10%=0%, which means that prices of goods made in China are decreased 10% by means of China government devaluing yuan 10%, and prices of goods made in China are increased 10% by meanings of USA government putting tariff 10% on all, and thus prices in trade not changed in total.

​4, ZTE is always controlled by China communists, and sells anti-freedom system to Iran and Korea, and banned by USA and then supported by USA later.

Just the first sentence I said, if you cannot read more sentences. ""Coward USA is too slow, which would make the war last long and thus make USA fail eventually.""

Coward USA is too slow, which would make the war last long and make USA fail. China yuan is already down 4% to USA dollar. So the real tariff in trade would be 10%-4%\*500/200=0% for the new 10% tariff on $200 billions of China goods.

Notice: $500 billions is the minimal of goods made in China exported to USA. So China yuan downing (or devaluation of China currency to America currency, now about 4% down) affects more than $500 billions goods exported to USA, but new tariffs expected only affects $200 billions goods exported to USA. So the result of the new tariffs on the whole trade of goods made in China but exported to America here is only 10%-4%\*500/200=0%.

Maybe USA can keep torturing Children (news about immigrants) and infants (news about USA believing cow milk is much better than mother milk or breast milk for infants), and make China communists keep stealing $375 billions and millions of American jobs from USA every year, since all these would make America great again.

Is USA a coward failure only shouting 200 billion and shouting 500 billion with doing nothing real while China communists have been keeping beating USA?

The simplest example in life to see the unfair robbery nature of China communists...(rob money from Chinese,rob work from American)

If you transfer money from banks not in China (for example, D) to China bank,Zero fee. But if you transfer back,that's to say, if you transfer money from China bank to banks not in China (for example,D), very high fee. That's the fairness? So, we got to know why China bank would not like fair competition with other banks, and China communists did unfair competition very well. (By the way, there is a little fact : China top four communist banks are the four biggest and richest banks all over the world. )

China bank says: If you transfer money out of mainland,for example, if you transfer money to USA , the fee is 1‰， 50￥ at least for each.And there is also tele fee,150￥ each time. And there also may be other fees. ​ So, if you are a Chinese and want to buy an American goods, you transfer 500￥ to your account outside China, and China bank just simply takes off more than 200￥ from you just because you want to buy an American goods. Moreover, if you take this American goods back to China, you may face high tax by China communists as well because American goods' prices are much higher in China than in America while many Chinese goods' prices are obviously lower in America than in China . So, we got to know why China goods would not like fair competition with America goods, and China communists did unfair competition very well. (By the way, there is a little fact: China communists legally steal $375 billions and millions of American jobs from USA in 2017 by anti-freedom trade.) ​And all above here lasts for decades!

Seen in ""China government has legally stolen 375.23 billions from USA in a single year by anti-freedom trade"" [http://bbs.aboluowang.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1062885&amp;extra=page%3D2](http://bbs.aboluowang.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1062885&amp;extra=page%3D2)

I am 27, and wanted to be an economist, however I lack the confidence of becoming one because I don't think I'm great at school. I have a full time job at a bank as a background screening analyst where I make around 45 k a year. I find that my peers all have their own side business, and I feel that I should have one too. However, I don't know what I have to offer to people and unable to think of something to offer services. I know I sound lost, but do you guys think that it would be important for this day and age to invest in a side business?

Let's say all basic work is automated and everybody would have enough money and ressources to live a decent life. Wouldn't that be paradise and finally set us free from the necessity to do things that we don't like at places we don't like 40 hours a week?

If everyone would have enough free time, without the pressure of how to pay the bills tomorrow, wouldn't we be able to focus on creating really beautiful things and everyone would have the chance to realize his/her own dreams and wishes, leading to more happiness in general?

820,d7xbgp,Economy; Strong or Weak?!,"As I am sure we all have heard lately about the dreaded inverted yield curve! What I want to know is just because an inverted curve has predicted every recession in the past, does that mean it has to happen this time? Well I can't sit here and tell you I know the answer to that, or that I even know someone who does. Here is what I think we need to look at. ***Macro Data*** is number one lets face it the over all market is still doing great. The wildfire that was 2017 is definitely slowing down but that doesn't mean we go cold. ***Earnings*** are number two they haven't been great but they have not been bad either. The Consumer Cyclical and Defense sectors are still reporting strong earnings and that means average joes are spending money which is always a sign of strong economy. Last but certainly not least is of course the ***China trade war.*** In the last few trading sessions we have seen huge market fluctuations on news of trade war talks and possible delay on tarriffs and then at the end of fridays session we saw a nose dive on the news that the Chinese left the meetings early. The volatility is great if you like to trade it, However it does cause many to be weary of the stock market. I think that all in all the indicator we use from our treasury bonds to decide if we are at the top or not has proven well in the past but that does not mean its has to. It seems to me to come down to one thing TRADE WAR! Contrary to the belief of our president tarriffs are starting to hurt the corporations which in turn will hurt consumers which in turn will lead to a bear market or even worse recession.

Personally I think its great that the [global car market is declining](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2019-09-20/electric-vehicle-market-so-far-belongs-to-china-k0scbcj0).

&gt;That change in buying cars also means a change in fuel consumption. China’s gasoline demand, after almost doubling between 2010  and July 2019, is now essentially flat.

916,d66mvh,Genuine downsides to universal basic income (UBI)?,"Hey r/economy, I’ve been doing a lot of research into UBI as of late due to 2020 presidential candidate discussions; particularly Andrew Yang’s promises of the Freedom Dividend (a universal basic income for everyone of $1,000 a month). He stands a decent chance of winning, and as a layman of economics, I wanted to come here for some thoughtful discussion on how his policies might change America.

The most simple question is why not to expect a general rise in prices due to the unconditional rise in wealth. Many sources say that because the money isn’t printed and is instead moved from wealthier entities, this isn’t the case. Could we expect any sort of changes in consumer prices, higher or lower, as result of a UBI?

Another allusion back to Yang’s platform, he proposes a 10% VAT tax on companies that provide less-necessary products and services to fund the UBI. Again, how would this effect the average person? Would it mean a degradation of quality in the markets that have previously been otherwise unrestricted by recurring taxes at a value of 10%? Changes in prices for those goods and services?

Finally, would this UBI in America be enough to have a large impact on lower class citizens? 12k a year is a decent amount, but seems a far cry from sustainable for those who might not be able to gain any more income due to certain circumstances. Would the UBI at least mean a decent, if not gradual reduction in the number of families below the poverty line? As automation overtakes jobs in America, would the UBI be a solid safety for those who are displaced in their career and must find new work?

I appreciate you taking the time to read, explain, and discuss. I simply want to know more about this economic structure that many claim is one of the best solutions for future unemployment in the face of automation.",0

953,d5qhea,what happens if the federal reserve cuts interest rates?,"is the interest rate that Trump's always complaining about the federal funds rate? is that a number that's just set or do they buy/sell securities in order to alter that number? I've always thought it was the latter because I hear people use the word ""target"" rate as if they're uncertain the Fed will hit it exactly.... but if this is the case then how is that different from quantitative easing? 

I assume that the Fed has been buying and selling government bonds since its conception, so is quantitative easing just buying on a greater scale? Are they buying different kinds of government bonds (longer term maybe)? 

tl;dr: 
are they setting the discount rate tomorrow? are they just making it a number or operating through the market? if the second one, how is that different from quantitative easing?",0

968,b1kvoh,Update,"r/economy is for news and discussion of the economy and economics - worldwide, national, and local. Markets, stock news, currency news, trade talks, industry news, and pretty much anything else related to the economy including economic theories and models. There are different types - if you want to discuss how laissez-faire economics compares to market socialism, or neoliberal economics vs. mercantilism, you can do that here. Neoclassical economics, Chicago School, Austrian School, Keynesian, Periphery/Core Analysis, Marxist, and everything in between, are all legitimate topics. Everyone is welcome no matter where you live or where you're from.

This is not a partisan or political sub. However, economics and politics are highly interrelated. There is an academic discipline called Political Economy. Political factors tend to determine economic outcomes. So attempts to split the two subjects are usually unsuccessful. Politics is generally going to leak into any discussion about money and economics. That's unavoidable and is perfectly ok.

That being said, there are rules in the sidebar. Everyone has had plenty of time to read them. From now on, they will be more strictly enforced. Anyone attempting to discredit sources and/or derail discussions by crying ""propaganda"", ""state-owned media"", ""You're a bot"", etc, is risking a ban. 

In addition, anyone expressing support for the terrorist in Christchurch yesterday, or previous such terrorist attacks, or any copycat attacks in the future, will be banned. There's no place for that here.",0

988,djnh3f,China government has legally stolen 375.23 billions job from USA in a single year of 2017 by anti-freedom trade (China government said 275.8 billions),"China government has legally stolen 375.23 billions job from USA in a single year of 2017 by anti-freedom trade (China government said 275.8 billions)

For decades, China government has stolen a lot of high techs from the United States, and for decades, American goods are generally heavily taxed by China government（visible and invisible to rocket the prices), while most Chinese goods are even not taxed in the United States (or taxed very little), which not only hurts American producers and American workers, but also hurts Chinese consumers because they cannot enjoy a lot of safe and cheap American goods, for decades!

(Of course not Boeing 737, because it probably kills thousands of customers over the world. For those death customers, it is sure that Boeing 737 is the unsafest product they had ever met, proved by their death.)

According to USA Census Bureau, China has stolen 375.23 billions from the United States in a single year of 2017. According to China Census Bureau, China has stolen 275.8 billions from the United States in a single year of 2017. President Trump only taxes China 60 billions in the early 2018? That is obviously not enough to get true free trade without tariffs.

""American goods are generally heavily taxed by China government（visible and invisible to rocket the prices), while most Chinese goods are even not taxed in the United States (or taxed very little), "" For example you buy an ordinary cheap USA good in Amazon or Walmart at $40, but in China you have to pay 600 Yuan (that is $95) in China's biggest B2C for the same USA good, and you can hardly get it in China's supermarkets. Cars are also an example, you buy an safe USA car in USA at $50000, but in China you may have to pay $100000 for the same USA car. Obviously, if all USA goods can be sold in China at the same price in USA, sales of USA goods would rocket definitely, and 375.23 (or 275.8) billions deficit would disappear definitely, and millions more Americans could have jobs definitely. Also Chinese consumers could enjoy a lot more safe and cheap American goods without deficit, and with spending much less money. And that is the true free trade.

Believing communists? Are you kidding me? In 1989,they killed more than ten thousand unarmed people in one day, by using machine guns and tanks! They said maybe a little hundreds of people are dead by accident, and they robbed all cameras even from Western diplomats without any explanation. In 1998，they said they bought the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov just for gambling business. Now it is well known as China's first aircraft carrier, starting to threaten America army. In 2001,they said they would open China's market to USA, and Chinese consumers have expected American goods for more than ten years, but still hard to buy or much more expensive than in USA, some of who fly to USA shopping. Ok, China consumers lost. USA lost (losing 375.23 billions to China government just in one year). Only China government won. Ok, some American companies also won,but only freedom lost (for example,USA company sold anti-freedom system to China, bingo, China sold anti-freedom system to Korea and Iran\[size=1em\])
