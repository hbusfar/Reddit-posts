# Reddit posts: Economy or Sport?


## Introduction

In project 3, we look at about 3000 posts from the sports and economy section of Reddit. We analyze the data and find the best model that correctly predicts which category each of the posts belong to. The data file is a .csv file called "reddit_posts.csv" along with a Jupyter notebook with the statistical analysis. A PDF of the presentation is also included in the project 3 folder. 



## Problem Statement:

We want to be able to correctly predict whether a Reddit post belongs to the economy or to the sport section of Reddit. 



## Executive Summary:

We used different models to correctly predict whether a post belongs to the economy or sport section of Reddit. Many of the sports posts and some of the economy posts were duplicates. The duplicate posts were ignored in our modeling. Our best model was able to correctly predict the class of the post with a %90 accuracy.
